Fix missing use-weaverse-data-context.ts file in Hydrogen package

## ðŸ”§ Build Fix

- **FIXED**: Added missing `use-weaverse-data-context.ts` file to Hydrogen package
- **FIXED**: Resolved build errors where imports couldn't resolve the module
- **MAINTAINED**: All data context functionality now properly available

## ðŸ“¦ Package Structure

The Hydrogen package now correctly includes:
- âœ… `useWeaverseDataContext()` hook
- âœ… `createWeaverseDataContext()` function
- âœ… `WeaverseDataContext` type
- âœ… All router-dependent functionality

## ðŸŽ¯ Impact
No functional changes - this is purely a build/packaging fix to ensure the file is included in published packages.

Fix dependency issue by moving react-router dependent code to Hydrogen package

## ðŸ”§ Dependency Fix

- **FIXED**: Moved `useWeaverseDataContext` and related functionality from `@weaverse/react` to `@weaverse/hydrogen`
- **FIXED**: Resolved build errors where React package tried to import `react-router` without it being a dependency
- **IMPROVED**: Made React package truly router-agnostic by using generic `DataContext` type
- **MAINTAINED**: All exports now available from `@weaverse/hydrogen` where `react-router` is properly installed

## ðŸŽ¯ Package Structure

### @weaverse/react (Router-agnostic)
- âœ… `replaceContentDataConnectors()`
- âœ… `replaceContentDataConnectorsDeep()`  
- âœ… Generic `DataContext` type
- âœ… Core React utilities

### @weaverse/hydrogen (Router-aware)  
- âœ… `useWeaverseDataContext()`
- âœ… `createWeaverseDataContext()`
- âœ… `WeaverseDataContext` type
- âœ… All React exports + Hydrogen-specific features

## ðŸ“¦ Usage Impact
No breaking changes - all functionality remains available from `@weaverse/hydrogen` as intended.

Fix PR review feedback - documentation and changeset compliance

Minor fixes to address PR review comments:

- Update CLAUDE.md version table with correct CLI version (3.0.0)
- Document CLI as JavaScript-only exception in TypeScript guidelines  
- Add changeset to satisfy changeset-bot requirements

Note: The major CLI modernization was already released as version 3.0.0.

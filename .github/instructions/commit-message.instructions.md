## Commit Message Guidelines

Write a clear and concise description of the code, including its purpose and functionality.
Make sure to include any important details or context that would help someone understand the code.
Make the commit short and descriptive, summarizing the changes made in a few words.
Do not use conventional commit message formats like "fix", "feat", or "chore".

# Frequently Asked Questions

Find answers to the most common questions about Weaverse development and usage.

## General Questions

### What is Weaverse?

Weaverse is a visual page builder and CMS designed specifically for Shopify Hydrogen storefronts. It allows developers to create customizable themes while giving merchants an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to build pages.

### How is Weaverse different from other page builders?

Weaverse is built specifically for Shopify Hydrogen and React Router v7. Unlike traditional page builders, it:

- Generates optimized static builds with zero runtime overhead
- Provides full developer control over component logic
- Integrates natively with Shopify APIs
- Supports server-side rendering and modern React patterns

### Do I need to know React to use Weaverse?

**For Merchants**: No, Weaverse provides a visual interface for building pages without any coding required.

**For Developers**: Yes, creating custom components requires React knowledge and familiarity with Shopify Hydrogen.

## Development Questions

### Can I use Weaverse with an existing Hydrogen project?

Yes! Weaverse can be added to existing Hydrogen projects. See our [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) for step-by-step instructions.

### What's the difference between components and sections?

- **Components**: Small, reusable UI elements (buttons, cards, forms)
- **Sections**: Page-level building blocks that can contain multiple components (headers, hero areas, product grids)

See [Components vs Sections](/docs/core-concepts/components-sections) for detailed explanations.

### How do I create a custom component?

1. Create a React component with props
2. Add a Weaverse schema defining the configuration options
3. Register the component in your Weaverse config

See the [Development Guide](/docs/development-guide/creating-components) for detailed examples.

### Can I style components with custom CSS?

Yes, you can use:
- Tailwind CSS classes (recommended)
- CSS modules
- Styled components
- Custom CSS files

Weaverse works with any styling approach compatible with Hydrogen.

## Performance Questions

### Does Weaverse affect site performance?

No, Weaverse is designed for optimal performance:

- Components are pre-rendered at build time
- No client-side page building JavaScript
- Automatic image optimization
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimized for Core Web Vitals

### How does caching work?

Weaverse leverages Hydrogen's caching strategies:
- Static pages are cached at the CDN level
- Dynamic content uses Shopify's cache tags
- Image assets are optimized and cached globally

## Shopify Integration Questions

### Which Shopify APIs does Weaverse use?

Weaverse uses:
- Storefront API for product data and cart operations

- B2B functionality

### How do I handle product variants?

Weaverse provides built-in components for variant selection, or you can create custom variant selectors. See [Product Variants Guide](/docs/features/product-variants).

Merchants often need to extend their store's capabilities with third-party apps for customer reviews, sales promotions,
and more to boost engagement and conversions. Weaverse facilitates two primary methods for integrating such apps into
your Hydrogen theme.

## Using the App's Component Library

If the third-party app offers a React component library, follow these steps:

1. Install the App library component

2. Add the App component to the page

Refer to detailed examples provided by app libraries, such
as [Okendo's Shopify Hydrogen Tutorial](https://github.com/okendo/okendo-shopify-hydrogen-demo/wiki/Okendo-Shopify-Hydrogen---Tutorial)
for guidance.

## Querying App Data from App's API

If the third-party app provides an API:

1. Secure the API Token:

- Store the third-party app's API token in your **`.env`** file.

2. Query App Data:

- Use the app's API within your route's loader function or a component's loader function to fetch data.

  ðŸ‘‰ [Review data fetching and caching practices](/docs/guides/fetching-and-caching).

- Display the fetched data on your Weaverse page effectively.

3. Example:

- Consult examples like the [Judge.me Shopify Hydrogen package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@judgeme/shopify-hydrogen)
  to understand data querying and rendering.

## Conclusion

Integrating third-party apps into your Weaverse Hydrogen theme can significantly enhance your store's features and
improve user engagement. By following the methods outlined above, merchants can ensure a seamless integration process,
leading to a more robust and feature-rich storefront.

## Introduction

Environment variables offer a mechanism to protect sensitive data, manage configurations, and streamline different
environments like development, testing, and production. In **Weaverse Hydrogen**, you'll frequently interact with a set
of predefined variables specially tailored for the framework.

## Essential Environment Variables for a Hydrogen Theme

1. **`SESSION_SECRET`**: A secret key used to sign session cookies. For more details, you can refer to
   the [Remix documentation on using sessions](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/remix#use-session).

2. **`PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN`**: The public access token for the Storefront API. This is not required if you are
   using the **`mock.shop`** demo setup.

3. **`PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN`**: The domain of the store used to communicate with the Storefront API. By default, if you're
   using the demo setup, the **`.env`** file will point to **`mock.shop`**.
4. **`PUBLIC_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_API_CLIENT_ID`**: The public access token for the Customer Account API. This is not required if you are using the old login method with password.
5. **`PUBLIC_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_API_URL`**: The API URL for the Customer Account API, it should look like this: `https://shopify.com/12345678`.

6. **`PRIVATE_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN`** (optional): The private access token for the Storefront API.

7. **`PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_VERSION`** (optional): The Storefront API version. If not specified, it defaults to the
   version of the Storefront API used by Hydrogen.

## Weaverse Specific Environment Variables

1. **`WEAVERSE_PROJECT_ID`**: A unique ID representing your specific **Weaverse** project. You can find this ID inside
   the Weaverse Studio under the **Project Settings**.

2. **`WEAVERSE_API_KEY`** (optional): Weaverse API Key that is retrieved from your Weaverse Account setting. This is used for some secured backend operations.

3. **`WEAVERSE_HOST`** (optional): The host URL for Weaverse services. If not specified, the default value is **`https://studio.weaverse.io`**.

## Setting Up Environment Variables

Define these environment variables in your **`.env`** file located at the root of your theme.

#### Using demo setup (with `mock.shop`)

```text data-line-numbers=false
SESSION_SECRET="my-secret-key"
PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN="mock.shop"
WEAVERSE_PROJECT_ID="weaverse-project-id"
```

#### When having a token

```text data-line-numbers=false
# These variables are only available locally in MiniOxygen

SESSION_SECRET="my-secret-key"
PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN="storefront-api-token"
PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN="my-store.myshopify.com"
PUBLIC_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_API_CLIENT_ID="customer-account-api-client-id"
PUBLIC_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_API_URL="https://shopify.com/12345678"
WEAVERSE_PROJECT_ID="weaverse-project-id"
```

ðŸ“Œ **Note**: Always avoid committing the **`.env`** file to version control. This could inadvertently expose sensitive
data. Instead, use the **`.env.example`** file to display the required variables without revealing the actual values.

## Obtaining the Public Storefront API Token

To get your **`PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN`** to preview your real store data, please install
the [Headless](https://apps.shopify.com/headless) or [Hydrogen](https://apps.shopify.com/hydrogen) app and
follow [this instruction](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/building-with-the-storefront-api/manage-headless-channels)
to obtain the _Storefront API Token_
<doc-warning>If you are on Shopify Starter plan, please create a custom app to obtain the Storefront API token. [Learn more](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-types/custom-apps) </doc-warning>

Then you can add them to the **.env** file.

## Using Environment Variables

Within your Weaverse Hydrogen theme, you can access environment variables via routes' `loader` function or Weaverse
component's `loader` function

For instance, within a **`loader`** function:

```tsx
import { json, type LoaderArgs } from '@shopify/remix-oxygen'

export async function loader({ context }: LoaderArgs) {
  // Get `env` variables from App Load Context
  let { env } = context

  return json({
    // ... route data
  })
}
```

Inside a **Weaverse** component's `loader`:

```tsx
import type { ComponentLoaderArgs } from '@weaverse/hydrogen'

export let loader = async ({ weaverse }: ComponentLoaderArgs) => {
  // Get `env` variables from `weaverse` client
  let { env } = weaverse

  return {
    // ... component loader data
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Correctly understanding and managing environment variables is crucial for both the security and functionality of your
Weaverse Hydrogen theme. Always ensure that they are treated with the utmost care, keeping any sensitive data well
protected.

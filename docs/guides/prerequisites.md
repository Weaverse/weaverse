Overview
--------

To ensure a seamless development experience with Weaverse Hydrogen, it's crucial to meet certain system prerequisites.
This article provides a checklist to get you started on the right foot.

Before Proceeding
-----------------

Before diving into Weaverse Hydrogen theme development, make sure you've:

* Installed the **Weaverse** app from the **Shopify** app store.

* Created a new project within Weaverse.

* Downloaded the Weaverse Hydrogen starter theme with `@weaverse/cli`

If you haven't completed these steps, refer back to the
**[Getting Started](/docs/hydrogen/getting-started)** article.

Shopify Requirements
--------------------

You should have:

* **Shopify Account**: A Shopify Basic account or higher is necessary to utilize the Shopify Hydrogen app.

* **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarize yourself with Shopify app and theme development.

Node.js and npm
---------------

Ensure your system is equipped with:

* **Node.js**: Version `16.x` or newer. Install from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org).

* **npm** (Node Package Manager): Usually bundled with Node.js. Ensure you have version `7.x` or newer.

Web Browsers
------------

For the best experience while developing and testing the themes, we highly recommend using the latest version of
any [Chrome-based browser](https://www.google.com/search?q=chrome+based+web+browsers):

* **Google Chrome**

* **Microsoft Edge**

* **Brave**

* **Opera**

Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
----------------------------------------

We recommend using:

* **Visual Studio Code** ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)): It offers a range of extensions and a large
  community. For an optimal experience with Weaverse, install
  the [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) extension.

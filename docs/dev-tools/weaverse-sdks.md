The Weaverse SDK is organized into multiple packages, each serving a specific role in the development of Weaverse
Hydrogen themes. These packages provide the necessary tools and functionalities for an efficient and streamlined
development process.

`@weaverse/core`
----------------

This foundational package contains the core logic of Weaverse and Weaverse Items, focusing on essential operations and
data handling within the Weaverse ecosystem.

`@weaverse/react`
-----------------

Specializing in the user interface, this package manages the rendering of Weaverse Items, which are built as React
components, ensuring proper display and interaction within the themes.

`@weaverse/hydrogen`
--------------------

Tailored for theme development, this package carries the logic required to build a Hydrogen Theme and facilitate its
integration with Weaverse Studioâ€™s customization features.

`@weaverse/cli`
---------------

A command-line tool included in the SDK, aiding developers in creating, managing, and deploying Weaverse Hydrogen themes
with ease and efficiency.

Open Source Plans
-----------------

Currently, the Weaverse SDK packages are private. Plans are underway to open-source the SDK by the end of this year,
promoting community access and contribution.

Text Element is one of the fundamental building blocks you need - it’s the most used element within any page builder.

To get started, open Element Library → drag the **Text element** onto your page!

### How To Add and Edit Text

To edit or add more text in the text box, simply select “Edit Text”.

You’ll also see a pop-up text editor giving you a lot of options to style your text - you choose from **bold**,
_italic_, underlined, and striking out. You can also adjust the font size, text alignment, or text colors.

To have more editing options, go to **Inspector** (_on the top right of the page editor_).

To add a background color or background image to your text box - go to the **Background** section.

To add shadows to your text or the text box, scroll down to the **Shadows and Effects** section. Here you can add
shadow, the color of the shadow, and the direction of the shadow to either your text or the text box, or both.

Button
------

The Button Element is one of the fundamental building blocks of any section. You can use it for a Call To Action -
_Learn More, Book A Call_, or _Direct visitors to your landing pages._

### Getting Started: Button

To use this element, simply drag and drop the button element onto the page.

* Step 01: Click the **Plus** icon to open Element Library.

* Step 02: Select, Drag and Drop the button element anywhere you like on your page editor.

* Step 03: Customize the button.

### How To Customize Button Element

There 02 types of customization you can do with **Button Element**:

* Customize its action and behavior.

* Customize its design and appearance.

To customize its behavior, simply select the button:

* Select the button, then select “Edit Button”

* In the pop-up button editor, you can change the **Button Text** and change **On Click Action**.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/621067366/c87e8a990d179ea6ae7c0fdd/button-action.gif)

To customize its appearance and design, select the button and open the Inspector panel. _(On the top right of the page
editor)_.

The options you see in the Inspector are specific to this element.

* State: Every button has 02 states. Normal and Hover. Select the state of the button first, then customize the button
  appearance for that state.

* Background: Change the background color of the button, or even add a background image to it.

* Dimensions: Define the button height and width. You can either set a fixed width and height for it or define **Min-Max
  Height** and **Min-Max Width** to make the button responsive on different devices.

* Spacing:

* Padding: The space within the element. Increasing/decreasing padding will also increase/decrease button size.

* Margin: The spacing surrounding an element. Margins are not a part of the element. Increasing margins will push other
  elements further away from your button, and vice versa.

* Border:

* Border Radius: If you want to make a rectangle button, keep the border-radius at 100. Suppose you want to round the
  edges of the button, slowly decrease the border radius until _it looks right to you._

* Border Style: Select the style you want - dotted border, dashed border, or solid border.

To learn more about our General Styling options, check
out [Styling Parameters](/docs/os2/general-styling).

or grayscale it.

Countdown
---------

### Getting Started: Countdown

Countdown Timer is the flavor of the month in every sales season - from Back To School to Black Friday, Halloween, and
Christmas. Merchants need it to create a sense of urgency for the products - **_get it now or lose the deal forever._**

Alternatively, Countdown Timer can be used to give visitors an estimated time of arrival for a special occasion - a new
collection drop, store opening, or new deal - of your business.

To use the Countdown Timer:

1. Click on the **Plus** icon to open Element Library.

2. Drag and drop the Countdown element you want into the page editor and then start using it.

### How To Edit Countdown Timer Content

To configure the countdown timer, select the element and open Inspector → General.

There are 02 ways to run your Countdown Timer: **_Evergreen_** and **_Fixed Time_**.

What do they mean?

* **Evergreen:** Start to countdown when visitors visit the page. Restart with every refresh. The total time to count
  down is defined in **“End in (Minutes)”** box. If you want to create an illusion of urgency - use Evergreen.

* **Fixed Time:** Start to countdown from the designated Start Time, and end on the designated Start Time. If you want
  the Countdown Timer to start and end at a point in the future - use Fixed Time.

![add and edit countdown timer in Weaverse](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/621348539/b1631a2cb3374ac43babd141/edit-countdown.gif)

Besides these options, you can also redirect users to another page when the countdown ended. Simply add the link under *
*_“Redirect when the timer stops”_** and enable **_“Open Link In A New Tab”_** if needed.

### How To Spice Up Your Countdown Timer

To tweak the styling and design of your countdown timer, select the element and open Inspector → Styles.

Under **Selector → Element**, you’d need to select which component of the Timer you want to customize first.

* **Countdown**: Overall Look and Feel of Countdown Timer.

* **Label Text**: The styling of days/hours/minutes/second text under Countdown Number.

* **Time Number**: The styling of the numbers.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/621349297/8dba789fb5d0d720dcc1778a/SCR-20221122-s93.png)

With each component, you can adjust its:

* **Alignment**: Go to the Alignment section and select the right alignment option.

* **Background**: Applicable for the Countdown component. You can add a background color or background image to your
  Timer.

* **Spacing**: Adjust the margins and paddings of each component.

* **Margin**: Margin is the spacing surrounding an element. It’s not a part of the element/component.

* **Padding**: Padding is the spacing within a component. Padding will push the content inside the component further in
  and create more space in the component.

* **Typography**: Font size, font color, and text alignment for the timer content.

Video
-----

### Getting Started: Video

Step 1: Click on the **Plus** icon to open **Element Library**

Step 2: Select, drag, and drop the element into the page editor to start using it.

### Adding Video

To add the video you want, simply select the element → Select Video → Add Video URL. You can also enable/disable:

* Control: Enabling control allows visitors to stop or rewind the video.

* Autoplay: Enable autoplay to make the video automatically play whenever a visitor lands on your page.

* Loop: Enable the **“Loop”** option to keep the video playing again and again.

* Mute.

devices” and keep “Visible on Mobile” enabled.

* Border style: Dashed, dotted, or solid.

Contact Form
------------

### Use Cases: Contact Form

The contact form element is an essential component for any storefront. It allows you to collect shopper information and
use it to convert potential visitors into buyers through targeted marketing campaigns.

You can also use it for a wide variety of purposes: collecting customer feedback, building a subscriber list - _if
you’re an aspiring creator like me :)_, or generating early interest in your product - _if you’re running a pre-launch
campaign_.

Form submissions will go directly to your **Sender Email -** usually the email you used to open your Shopify account.
You can change it in **Settings** > **Store Details > Profiles.**

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/705070411/b62eaab945896b01558737b6/image.png)

Product Details
---------------

### Use Cases: Product Details

The **Product Details** element is a powerful tool that enables you to showcase your products in detail. With this
feature, you can present your products in a way that captures your customers' attention and highlights their unique
features.

By adding it to sections created with Weaverse, you can proudly showcase your products on essential landing pages like
Homepage, Collection pages, Product pages, or even About Us page.

### How To Use Product Details Element In Weaverse

#### Drag and drop the Product Details element to your desired location on Section Editor.

Like all elements in Weaverse, you can find the Product Details element in our element library.

Using _Weaverse’s Powerpoint-like editor_, you can also resize and make the Product Details element fit nicely with
other elements on the page, to create an eye-pleasing look.

#### Edit Product Details Content

The Product Details element contains all essential product information and media assets you have. You can use our Layout
to select which specific component of the Product Details element you want to edit.

With Weaverse’s Product Details element, you can adjust;

  product title - based on your styling presets).

  Details button (either open the full description, or direct shoppers to the product pages).

Each component in the Product Details element can be styled using our default Styling options. Learn more about
it [here](/docs/os2/general-styling).

Scrolling Text is designed to be versatile. With scrolling Text, you can:

* Add a sliding Sales Announcement/Discounts banner.

* Put up a Welcome scrolling banner to make your shoppers feel at home.

* Or add a pun, an intelligent joke, or a heartfelt note to show your unique brand personality.

Here's how you can use it in Weaverse

### How to Use Scrolling Text Element In Weaverse

#### Open our Element library and select the Scrolling Text element.

![weaverse scrolling text element](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/700077428/7f4e87a47d6fab0bb606d5b1/scrolling-text+%281%29.png)

#### Drag and drop it anywhere on the page.

You don't need to worry about the layout; our Smart Grid Editor will help you. Drag, move, resize, and crop it like
Canva.

![weaverse scrolling text element demo](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/700077785/aaaad1d62c1ae1a12b1e2d44/Scrolling-text+%282%29.png)

#### Select the element and select "Edit text" in the toolbox above the Scrolling Text.

![weaverse scrolling text config](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/700078002/fc51f023b7d365fb8cf96d36/Untitled+%281%29.png)

#### Add the Text you want to show in the text editor and tweak it your way.

* Gap: Adjust the width of the space between Text. We recommend keeping it at 44px for the best consumption experience.

* Speed: How fast you want the scrolling/sliding Text to go.

* Pause on hover: Let visitors read the complete text in case they want to.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/700078278/66328081c662c7d867f96b7e/Scrolling-text+%283%29.png)

Suggest (At the right corner of the editor): Weaverse AI to help you automate text generation in case of writer's
block :)

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/700078446/14d189aad88f8c9fdc77aaa9/Untitled+%282%29.png)

Note: You can also have different styles for your Scrolling Text when hovering by going to Inspector → set the state to
Hover → and customize the styling (things like Text color, font size, etc. - you know the drill).

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/700078560/6bd3808b041fd19f82cca445/Scrolling-text+%284%29.png)

That's it. Super easy and barely an inconvenience :)

Hotspots
--------

### Use Cases: Hotspots

Shoppable Images, or Hotspots - as we named them in Weaverse, are clickable icons that will show the different products
in your shoppable images upon clicks.

![Hotspots element in Weaverse](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/704955676/6ade291f3eacce2e54082802/hotspot-05.jpeg)

Weaverse is currently **the only Shopify page builder** with Hotspots available natively within the app - you either
bought a premium Theme at $320+ (_looking at you, Prestige Theme_) or purchased a 3rd-party Shopify app to have
Shoppable Gallery.

_(**That’s too much hassle for our users** - and because you should spend more time on building a brand, instead of
finding an app for Shoppable Images - here it arrives! )_

Combine Hotspots with Weaverse’s Powerpoint-like editor and you have an eye-pleasing shoppable image gallery - like
this.

### How To Use Hotspots Element

#### Add the element to the editor

Open our element library, then drag and drop the Hotspots element to your desired location on the editor.

![Hotspots element in Weaverse element library](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/704955946/7110b3133b18ad82bc3b7148/hotspots-03.png)

**Customize Hotspots content**

Once you've added the element to your page, click on it to select it. You should see a toolbar appear at the top of the
screen with a button labeled _"Edit Hotspots"_. Click on this button to open the Hotspots editor.

![Customize Hotspots content](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/704956108/fc80087a465c769904f780a5/hotspot-02.png)

Here you have a few customization options, including:

* Add hotspot items: The products you want to add as hotspots. You can add several products to the same image.

* Click the item to add the product you want to showcase and adjust the position of the hotspot on the image - using
  _Offset X: how the hotspot is located horizontally_, and _Offset Y: how the hotspot is located vertically._

  ![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/704956232/aac435a09e5fac8f2b607078/hotspot-01.png)

* You can also add more products to your shoppable images. Click ‘Add more item” and repeat the process.

* You can also change the Hotspots icon: A dot, a tag, a shopping bag, or a plus sign.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/704956551/8e758ff27af9e9d82dc3bfd7/hotspot-06.png)

In the screenshot, you might see that the hotspot icon looks like a googly eye.

Like the googly eye in [Everything Everywhere All At Once](https://youtu.be/wxN1T1uxQ2g), it’s a reminder that _life is
inherently meaningless_. It’s scary, yet liberating because it means that it’s up to us to create our own meaning. A
reminder to believe in a universe that doesn’t care, and in people who do.

Google Map
----------

### Use Cases: Google Map

With the Google Map element, you can easily add a customized map to your storefront that displays your business
location, store hours, and other important information.

### How To Add Google Map Element

#### Open Weaverse and Add the Google Map element.

Once you are in Weaverse, go to the element library on the left-hand side of the screen.

To add the Google Map Element, simply click on it and drag it to the desired location on the section editor.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/704953816/4619201d1b65b9456c9cc870/map.png)

#### Add the location

Select the Google Map element, then select “Set Location”, then enter the address.

That’s it.

You can also resize it, crop it, move it around, bring it forward, or move it backward - just like how you use
PowerPoint.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/704953447/62d4f268acdd711ac3cd809a/ggmap.gif)

Product List
------------

### Use Cases: Product List

The Product List element is the fundamental building block of any storefront - designed to help you showcase your
products and help your customers find what they are looking for.

### How To Add Product Lists Element

#### Open Weaverse and Add the Product List element.

Once you are in Weaverse, go to the element library on the left-hand side of the screen.

To add the Product List Element, simply click on it and drag it to the desired location on your storefront.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/700922669/1fd60d56ff16d858745baad2/product+list.png)

#### Customizing the Product List Element

After adding the Product List Element to your storefront, you can customize it to display your products in the way you
want.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/700922760/6e0511634cc64265fefa5e8f/Untitled+%283%29.png)

To do this, click on the Product List Element to bring up its settings → click Edit Product List:

* Source: You can display products from _a specific collection_ or from _Recommended Products_. Or you can display
  specific products from several collections simultaneously using _Fixed Products._

* You can choose from various formats, such as a grid or carousel (slide).

* You can also choose how many products to display in a row.

#### Customizing Product Card

With Weaverse, you can also customize Product Card content.

A product card is a design block inside your Product List, typically consisting of an image of the product, its name,
price, and some brief details or specifications.

To edit the Content Card's content, select Product List → Edit Product Card.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/700922907/f8eb0f2905494a9f1e384a03/Untitled+%284%29.png)

Here you have a few options:

* Image aspect ratio: To adjust the width and height of the product images in the Product List.

* Show the second image on hover: _Enabled by default,_ as it makes the shopping experience more hassle-free. Shoppers
  don't need to click to view more images.

* Show sale badge: _Enabled by default,_ and it will be shown if your products are on sale.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/700923055/470145634d202805347e44b2/Untitled+%285%29.png)

**View details button text:** _Enabled by default._ This button is shown inside the Product Cards when hovering.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/700923158/78ebac58288d276e82c635d4/Untitled+%286%29.png)

* **Show quick view:** _Enabled by default._ This option adds the eye icon on Product Card so that when a shopper clicks
  on it, a _Product Detail Pop-up page_ will be shown for shoppers to add the product to their cart easily.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/700923253/470c872e2e2b14bd07864ad8/Untitled+%287%29.png)

* **Customizer**: Customize swatches. This option will help you add more product swatches - including Color and Size.
  You can set up these product swatches
  in [Styling Presets](/docs/os2/styling-presets).

#### Customize Styling Options of Product List Element

In addition to choosing product selection, you can also customize the styling options of the Product List Element.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/700923484/93411a09b9c9456cd27e7e18/style+edit.png)

To do this, click on the "Style" tab on the left of the screen; here, you can customize various styling aspects of the
Product List block:

* Background: Background color and background image.

* Spacing: Padding and Margin of Product List content.

* Typography: Font size, Text style, Text colors, etc., _of all text components_ in the Product List element (Product
  Title, Product Price, Product Description, etc.).

* Border: Border styles, colors, and radius.

To learn more about these available styling options, check
out [this article](https://help.weaverse.io/en/articles/6761250-general-styling-options).

#### Spice up your layout (optional)

What makes Weaverse different is our Powerpoint-like editor, where you can drag and move an element anywhere, crop it,
and resize it with unprecedented ease. This works for all elements.

Let's say you want to build a layout with a Product List and an Advertising video.

**With other page builders:** You'd need to define how many columns and rows you need. Then choose a layout element with
the right number of columns. Then drag and drop each element into a column. Then adjust the padding and the margin to
make them fit together.

_(If you're familiar with Shopify page builders, you know what I mean :). If not, try some, and you'll see._

**With Weaverse:** You drag and drop and move things around. That's it.

Collection List: Collection List
---------------

**Collection List** is designed to present your list of Shopify collections in sections created with Weaverse. Some of
its use cases include:

* **Upsell/Cross-sell:** You’re building a product page and want people to know you have more collections of similar
  products.

* **Engage Shoppers:** You have a series of high-traffic blog posts and you want to monetize the organic free traffic.
  You can put a Collection List at the end of each blog post to drive more eyeballs to your products.

### Getting Started

To use Collection List, simply click the Plus icon to open Element Library → Scroll down to the Shopify section → Drag
and drop the element into the page editor.

To add Collections to your Collection List, select the element → Click “Select Collection” → Then select all collections
you want to show.

You also have the option to adjust _The Number of Collections_, _Collections Per Slide,_ and _The Spacing Between
Collections._

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/621376580/ddf95ce2c9e908fde767f84b/adding-collection.gif)

### How To Edit Collection Lists’ Styles

Similar to other elements, you can use our universal styling options under the Styles Tab. You can learn more
about [Styling Parameters](/docs/os2/general-styling) here.

Besides the general styling options like Background, Typography, Borders, Margin and Padding, you can also configure its
visibility.

* Enable “Visible On All Devices” if you want your Collection List visible to all visitors.

* Enable “Visible On Mobile” if you just want to show your Collection List to mobile users.

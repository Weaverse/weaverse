Taking the First Step
---------------------

Embarking on your journey with **Weaverse** is straightforward. In this guide, you'll learn how to seamlessly integrate the Weaverse app into your Shopify store and lay the foundation for your first **Weaverse Hydrogen** project.

Trying Before Committing: The Weaverse Playground
-------------------------------------------------

If you're not yet ready to commit to installing the app and setting things up, no worries! We have a playground set up just for you. Head over to the [Weaverse Playground](https://studio.weaverse.io/demo) to explore the features hands-on. And if you need some guidance, check out our quick tour video below.

Install the Weaverse App from the Shopify App Store
---------------------------------------------------

Before you can begin using the Weaverse Hydrogen Theme Customizer, you'll need to install the Weaverse app. Visit the [Shopify app store](https://apps.shopify.com/weaverse) and search for "Weaverse." Click on the app and follow the instructions to install it.

#### Create New Project

In the **Weaverse** dashboard, you'll find a button to create a new project (also referred to as a _storefront_). Click that button to begin the creation process.

#### Select a Starter Theme

You'll be presented with various Hydrogen starter templates to choose from. By default, "**Pilot**" (free) will be available as the first starter theme. Select this theme or any other that fits your needs.

#### Initialize the Project

Follow the instructions that are used `@weaverse/cli` to clone the project repository to your local machine. This will include all the necessary files to begin development.

#### Enter the Development Server Preview URL

Input the development server preview URL to the Preview URL input (default is `http://localhost:3456`) into the provided field, and then click "Next."

You can change the Preview URL later in the **Project Settings**, like in the following screenshot:

ðŸ’¡ **Note**: it is highly recommended to use **Chrome Browser** to access the app, as **Safari** and some others may not allow opening the `localhost`.

#### Explore the Theme Customizer

Now, you will see the Theme Customizer for your Hydrogen project. It's designed to be very similar to **Shopify's OS2 Theme Customizer**, making it intuitive for those familiar with Shopify's environment.

#### Start Adding Sections and Editing

With the Theme Customizer open, you can now add sections and edit them to fit your needs. The interface is user-friendly, allowing you to make changes with ease.

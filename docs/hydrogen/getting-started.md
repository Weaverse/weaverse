Taking the First Step
---------------------

Embarking on your journey with **Weaverse** is straightforward. In this guide, you'll learn how to seamlessly integrate the Weaverse app into your Shopify store and lay the foundation for your first **Weaverse Hydrogen** project.

Trying Before Committing: The Weaverse Playground
-------------------------------------------------

If you're not yet ready to commit to installing the app and setting things up, no worries! We have a playground set up just for you. Head over to the [Weaverse Playground](https://studio.weaverse.io/demo) to explore the features hands-on. And if you need some guidance, check out our quick tour video below.

Install the Weaverse App from the Shopify App Store
---------------------------------------------------

Before you can begin using the Weaverse Hydrogen Theme Customizer, you'll need to install the Weaverse app. Visit the [Shopify app store](https://apps.shopify.com/weaverse) and search for "Weaverse." Click on the app and follow the instructions to install it.

Creating a New Weaverse Hydrogen Project
----------------------------------------

#### Create New Project

![Create Weaverse Hydrogen Project](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0728/0410/6547/files/create_weaverse_hydrogen_project.webp)

In the **Weaverse** dashboard, you'll find a button to create a new project (also referred to as a _storefront_). Click that button to begin the creation process.

#### Select a Starter Theme

![Select Weaverse Starter theme](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0728/0410/6547/files/select_weaverse_starter_theme.webp)

You'll be presented with various Hydrogen starter templates to choose from. By default, "**Pilot**" (free) will be available as the first starter theme. Select this theme or any other that fits your needs. After you selected the theme, a default name and generated data will be provided for your project.


#### Try the demo
You will use the default Preview URL for demo purpose, just look around, inspect the features, change the content, and see how it works.

Now when you are ready to start building or deploy the project, click on the "Start Setup" button.

#### Enter the Development Server Preview URL

Input the development server preview URL to the Preview URL input (default is `http://localhost:3456`) into the provided field, and then click "Next."

You can change the Preview URL later in the **Project Settings**, like in the following screenshot:

ðŸ’¡ **Note**: it is highly recommended to use **Chrome Browser** to access the app, as **Safari** and some others may not allow opening the `localhost`.

#### Explore the Theme Customizer

Now, you will see the Theme Customizer for your Hydrogen project. It's designed to be very similar to **Shopify's OS2 Theme Customizer**, making it intuitive for those familiar with Shopify's environment.

#### Start Adding Sections and Editing

With the Theme Customizer open, you can now add sections and edit them to fit your needs. The interface is user-friendly, allowing you to make changes with ease.

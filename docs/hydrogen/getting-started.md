## Taking the First Step

Welcome to **Weaverse**! This guide will walk you through integrating the Weaverse app with your Shopify store and initiating your first **Weaverse Hydrogen** project.

## Exploring Before Committing: The Weaverse Playground

Not ready to install the app just yet? Try out our [Weaverse Playground](https://studio.weaverse.io/demo) to get a feel for the features. For guidance, watch our brief tutorial video below.

## Installing the Weaverse App from the Shopify App Store

Select from various Hydrogen starter themes. The default "Pilot" theme is free and a great starting point.

#### Experiment with the Demo

Use the default Preview URL to explore the theme's features and interface.

When ready, click "Start Setup" to proceed with building or deploying your project.

#### Setting Up Your Project

Choose from two setup options:

- **For Developers**: Clone the project locally or use our command to start the development server.
- **For Non-Developers**: Follow our guide to deploy the project live. This option is less technical. For more information, refer to our [deployment guide](/docs/deployment/oxygen).

#### Accessing the Development Server

After setup, enter the development server preview URL (default `http://localhost:3456`) in the Preview URL field and click "Next."

Note: You can later modify the Preview URL in the **Project Settings**:

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Use a **Chrome-based Browser** for optimal experience. Browsers like **Safari** may not support `localhost`.

#### Exploring the Theme Customizer

The Theme Customizer is designed to mirror Shopify's OS2 Theme Customizer for ease of use.

#### Adding Sections and Customizing

Start adding and customizing sections in the user-friendly Theme Customizer.

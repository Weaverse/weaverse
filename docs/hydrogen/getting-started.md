Browse our collection of Hydrogen starter themes. We recommend the "Pilot" theme for beginnersâ€”it's free and packed with essential features to get you started quickly.

When you're satisfied with your preview, click "Start Setup" to move forward with building or deploying your project.

### Step 4: Choose Your Setup Path

Select the option that matches your technical expertise:

- **Developer Path**: Clone the project locally or use our provided command to launch the development server
- **No-Code Path**: Follow our streamlined deployment guide to take your project live with minimal technical knowledge. For detailed instructions, check our [deployment guide](/docs/deployment/oxygen)

### Step 5: Connect to Your Development Server

After setup, enter your development server preview URL (default: `http://localhost:3456`) in the Preview URL field and click "Next."

**Pro Tip**: You can update your Preview URL anytime through the **Project Settings**:

ðŸ’¡ **Best Practice**: For the optimal experience, use a **Chrome-based browser**. Some browsers like **Safari** may have limitations with `localhost` connections.

### Step 6: Master the Theme Customizer

Our intuitive Theme Customizer mirrors Shopify's OS2 interface, making it familiar and easy to use for Shopify store owners.

### Step 7: Customize to Your Heart's Content

# Getting Started with Weaverse

- **Component Library**: Pre-built sections and reusable components
- **Developer APIs**: Full control over components, data, and styling
- **Performance First**: Zero runtime overhead with optimized builds
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with React 19 Compiler

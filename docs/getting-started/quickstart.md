## Step 7: Connect Your Real Store Data

Right now you're seeing demo content. Let's connect your actual store data:

### Option A: For Paid Shopify Stores (Recommended)

1. **Install Hydrogen App**
   - Go to https://apps.shopify.com/hydrogen
   - Install the **Hydrogen** app (by Shopify)
   - This creates a Hydrogen sales channel

2. **Pull Store Environment**
   ```bash
   # Make sure you're in your theme folder
   cd my-hydrogen-storefront
   
   # Pull your store's environment variables
   npx shopify hydrogen env pull
   ```

3. **Follow CLI Prompts**
   - Select your Shopify store
   - Choose your Hydrogen project
   - The CLI will automatically update your `.env` file

4. **Restart Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Option B: For Development/Trial Stores

1. **Create Storefront API Token**
   - In Shopify Admin, go to **Apps > Develop apps**
   - Click **Create an app** 
   - Name it "Weaverse Storefront"
   - Alternative: Use the **Headless** app (https://apps.shopify.com/headless) for easier setup
   - Configure **Storefront API scopes** and enable all permissions

2. **Update Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Edit your .env file with:
   PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN=your-store.myshopify.com
   PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN=your_generated_token
   ```

3. **Restart Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### CLI Command Not Working
**Problem**: The generated CLI command fails to run
**Solutions**:
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed: `node --version`
- Check internet connection for downloading packages
- Try running with npm directly: `npm create @weaverse/cli@latest create --template=pilot ...`
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`

### Studio Preview Not Loading  
**Problem**: Weaverse Studio shows a blank preview or connection error
**Solutions**:
- Verify development server is running on port 3456
- Check that `http://localhost:3456` loads in your browser
- Ensure no firewall is blocking port 3456
- Try refreshing the Studio page

### Demo Data Still Showing
**Problem**: Still seeing demo products instead of your store data
**Solutions**:
- Make sure you completed Step 7 (Connect Real Store Data)  
- Verify your `.env` file has correct store domain and API token
- Restart the development server: `Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev`
- Check Shopify store has products published to "Online Store" sales channel

### "Module not found" Errors
```bash
# If packages failed to install properly
cd my-hydrogen-storefront
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json  
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Port 3456 Already in Use
```bash
# Kill any process using port 3456
npx kill-port 3456

# Or start on a different port
npm run dev -- --port 3457
```
*Note: If you change the port, update the Preview URL in Weaverse Studio accordingly*

### Environment Variables Not Working
**Problem**: Store data or Weaverse features not working
**Solutions**:
- Ensure `.env` file is in the project root (same level as `package.json`)
- Check variable names are exactly correct (case-sensitive)
- Restart development server after any `.env` changes
- Verify no spaces around the `=` sign in environment variables

Description
-----------

* The pricing is set to be released in November 2023.

* The Vanguard phase represents a special pricing period for Weaverse. With Shopify Hydrogen, Headless Commerce, and
  particularly Weaverse being newcomers in the market, our primary goal is to encourage adoption. By offering a 50%
  discount during this phase, we aim to make the transition to Hydrogen & Headless composable commerce more accessible
  and affordable for all merchants.

* The Vanguard period concludes at the end of Q1-2024. New users will apply the original price.

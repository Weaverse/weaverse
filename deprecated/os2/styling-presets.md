## Use Case

Imagine you have 100 sections on 100 pages. Each has two H2 headings - totaling up to 200 H2 headings.

Now you want to change the font size of all H2 headings. What would you do?

- A: Change 200 headings manually in each section.

- B: Change one thing, and every H2 headings will automatically update to match the changes.

This is one of the many use cases of Styling Presets.

Styling Preset is a powerful design tool that helps you maintain consistency in the look and feel of your website. By
applying preset styles across multiple pages and elements, you can create a unified brand identity and streamline the
design process.

Here are some of the most common use cases and applications of Global Styling.

- **Brand Identity:** By using consistent typography, colors, and other design elements, you create a cohesive visual
  language that resonates with your target audience and reinforces brand recognition.

- **Design Efficiency:** You can streamline the design process by allowing you to apply preset styles to various
  elements and pages with just a few clicks. This saves you time and effort when creating new pages or updating existing
  ones, as you won't need to manually adjust the styling for each individual element.

- **Ease of Maintenance**: If you decide to change a specific style aspect, like the primary color or font, you can
  easily update the global style settings, and the changes will be applied across your entire site or app. This
  eliminates the need to edit each element or page individually.

## How Styling Presets Work

Let’s make another example.

You’re building a page and just added a text element. You want this element to have the same font size as the other H2
headings.

Now you can just _Select text element > Scale text > and add the same font size as other H2 headings._

But imagine you have more than 01 heading, then doing so would take too much time.

What you can do is _Select the text > Styles > Select Heading 2 preset_. That’s it.
